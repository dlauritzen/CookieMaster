# CookieMaster

My ultimate [Cookie Clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) add-on.

Inspired by (and generally stolen from):

 * CookieMonster: https://github.com/Aktanusa/CookieMonster
 * CookieBot: https://github.com/prinzstani/CookieBot

This add-on helps people play Cookie Clicker, or simply plays it for them. My
goal is to bring in everything I like from other add-ons and add my own spin.

# Installing The Add-On

Save this text as a bookmark, or open the Console and copy the `Game.LoadMod`
line.

```javascript
javascript: (function () {
    Game.LoadMod('https://dlauritzen.github.io/CookieMaster/CookieMaster.js');
}());
```
